What is the unit of observation?

--

*A restaurant*

---
# What determines the price of a meal?
--

Let's look at the relationship between price, food rating, and decor rating.

$$Price \sim Food + Decor$$

--

```{r}
m1 <- lm(Price ~ Food + Decor, data = nyc)
```

# Model 1: Food + Decor

# The geometry of regression models 

The function for $\hat{y}$ is . . .

--

- A *line* when you have one continuous $x$.

--

- *Parallel lines* when you have one continuous $x_1$ and one categorical $x_2$.

--

- *Unrelated lines* when you have one continuous $x_1$, one categorical $x_2$, 
and an interaction term $x_1 : x_2$.

--

When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, then your mean function
is . . .

--

*a plane*

       xlab = "Food rating", ylab = "Decor Rating", zlab = "Price")

planes3d(coefs["Food"], coefs["Decor"], -1, coefs["(Intercept)"],
         alpha = 0.4, col = "lightgray")
```


---
# Location, location, location
--

Does the price depend on where the restaurant is located in Manhattan?

$$Price \sim Food + Decor + East$$

---
# The geometry of regression models 
--

- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, then your mean function
is *a plane*.

--

- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, and a categorical 
predictor $x_3$, then your mean function represents *parallel planes*.

plot3d(x = nyc$Food, y = nyc$Decor, z = nyc$Price, col = colvec,

# The geometry of regression models

- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, then your mean function
is *a plane*.

--

- When you have two continuous predictors $x_1$, $x_2$, and a categorical 
predictor $x_3$, then your mean function represents *parallel planes*.

--

- When you add in interaction effects, the planes become *tilted*.

```

# Comparing Models
--

- The `East` term was significant in model 2, suggesting that there is a 
significant relationship between location and price.

--

- That term became nonsignificant when we allowed the slope of `Decor` to vary
with location, and that difference in slopes was also nonsignificant.

--

- Notice that slope estimate for a given variable will almost *always* change 
depending on the other variables that are in the model.
