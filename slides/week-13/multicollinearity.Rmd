What factors help explain the price of a home in Los Angeles?


---
# Model building
--

We'd like to build a model to explain prices of homes in LA as a function of
the characteristics of those homes.

$$ \widehat{price} = location + size + pool + acreage \ldots $$

1. Statistical question
2. Data wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Modeling
5. Interpretation

Consider: *exploratory* vs. *confirmatory* analysis.


---
# Data wrangling  
--

Home price data is available on many websites now, including zillow.com.

.tiny[
```{r load-data}
LA <- read.csv("../data/LA.csv")
head(LA)
```
]

--

**Unit of observation**: a home for sale in west LA.  
**Population**: all homes in west LA.

# Recoding `type`
--

The levels of a categorical variable can be queried using `levels()`.

```{r data-3}
levels(LA$type)
```

--

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(type = fct_recode(type,
                           "unknown" = "",
                           "condo"   = "Condo/Twh",
                           "sfr"     = "SFR"))
levels(LA$type) <- c("unknown", "condo", "sfr")
```

```{r}
levels(LA$type)
```

# Recoding `garage`
--

```{r data-4}
str(LA)
```

What's going on with garage?


---
# Recoding `garage`, cont.
--

```{r data-5}
levels(LA$garage)
```

--

```{r}
count(LA, garage)
```


---
class:small
# Recoding `garage`, cont.

We can combine levels using a similar approach.

--

```{r}
LA <- LA %>%
  mutate(garage = fct_collapse(garage,
                           "small" = c("", "1"),
                           "large" = c("2", "3", "4+")))
```

--

```{r}
count(LA, garage)
```


---
class:small
# Data wrangling, cont.
--

```{r}

```

What's going on with `pool` and `spa`?


---
class:small
# Dropping columns
--

```{r}
count(LA, pool)
```

--

```{r}
LA %>%
  summarize(nas = sum(is.na(spa)))
```

--

Two variables seem mis-coded/uninformative, so they should be dropped.

```{r}
LA <- select(LA, -pool, -spa)
```


---
# Fully wrangled data set
--

```{r}
head(LA)
```

Once the data set is ready to go, save it to a new .csv file.

```{r eval = FALSE}
write.csv(LA, file = "LA.csv")
```


---
# Exploratory Data Analysis
--

Our goals are to:

--

1. Develop a sense of the *univariate* distributions in terms of center, shape, spread, unusual observations.

--

2. Develop a sense of the *bivariate* and *multivariate* distributions and what
they indicate about the relationship between variables.


---
# Question  
--

Which of the following are *not* good methods to visualize the distribution
of a single variable?

1. mosaic plot
2. density plot
3. scatterplot
4. histogram
5. side-by-side boxplots

```


---
# Transformations  
--

Highly skewed data (particularly the response) can be very difficult to model using least squares regression. A common solution is to consider a transformation of the variable.

$$ \widehat{price} \sim sqft $$

versus

$$\widehat{log(price)} \sim log(sqft) $$

  # Make a list from the ... arguments and plotlist

  # If layout is NULL, then use 'cols' to determine layout
  if (is.null(layout)) {
    # Make the panel

# Transformation, cont.
--

Highly skewed data often leads to invalid models. This can be often be fixed 
with a transformation, but the interpretations change slightly.

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary(m2)$coef
```

*A one unit increase in the log sqft of a home is associated with a 1.44 unit
increase in the log price of a home.*


---
# Modeling: a simple model for price  
--

$$ \widehat{log(price)} \sim bed $$

```{r}
m3 <- lm(logprice ~ bed, data = LA)
```

--

What do you expect the *sign* of the slope for `bed` to be?

--

```{r}
summary(m3)$coef
```


---
# A less simple model for price  
--

$$ \widehat{log(price)} \sim bed + log(sqft) $$

```{r}
m4 <- lm(log(price) ~ bed + logsqft, data = LA)
```

--

What do you expect the *sign* of the slope for `bed` and `logsqft` to be?

--

```{r}
summary(m4)$coef
```


---
# Multicollinearity
--

Correlation between the predictors has some important consequences:

1. Addition or removal of correlated predictors can lead to slope sign changes.
2. Correlation between the predictors leads to an inflated $SE(b_1)$.

In sum: multicollinearity leads to **instability** in your estimates.

---
# The SE of the slope  
--

In the case of a MLR model with two correlated predictors,

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon $$

If $r_{1,2}$ is the correlation between $X_1$ and $X_2$, then.

$$SE(b_i) \propto \frac{\sigma}{1 - r_{1,2}}$$


---
# Multicollinearity
--

**Take-home lesson**: if your predictors are correlated, then they're carrying
the same information about the response and your model with have a difficult
time attributing explanatory power to this variable or that.

--

One approach: remove one/some of the correlated predictors.

--

Another approach: be ok with the flipping signs. Think of each model as an answer to a specific question.
